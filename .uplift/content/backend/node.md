## Backend challenge: NodeJS

If you are working with node instead of Django, we'd like you to do the same backend challenge with TypeScript and GraphQL.

There is a starter server you can use in `node-server/`, and it runs CI using `.github/workflows/backend_node.yml`. Please make sure the build passes.

To start the node server, run `npm run start:server`. The GraphiQL interface will run at http://localhost:8000/graphql.
