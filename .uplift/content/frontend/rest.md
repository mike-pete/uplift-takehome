### Troubleshooting & Tips

If you have any issues with husky/commit hooks, you may remove the \*.py section of "lint-staged" in package.json

Additionally, if you're on Windows, check out this tip for [yarn with husky on Windows](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=yarn-on-windows).

### Linting

CI runs prettier and eslint. Configuring your editor/IDE appropriately will make it easier for you to ensure passing CI tests when you submit.
