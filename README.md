# Uplift Interview

Welcome!

## Intro

This repository contains the Uplift coding challenge.
We believe in letting you work as freely as you want within the constraints of the project. Our goals are to assess:

- your ability to follow specs/requirement docs, making pragmatic decisions along the way
- your level of expertise (mid-level=good approach, expert level=teach us something we don't know)

## Getting Started

Please run `npm run setup` in your terminal to choose a challenge and generate further instructions.

## License and sharing

This repository is intended to be private. You are not allowed to share any of the base template code without Uplift's express permission. Please reach out to us **before** you share any of the code in this repository with others.

That said, we understand you may want to show others your work. If you're proud of your work on this exercise and want to share it with future companies or add to your portfolio, we kindly request you help us keep the codebase as private as possible. If it's easy for other candidates to find a good coding exercise submission, they will, and then we have to invest a bunch of time to change the requirements so that old examples cannot be used. Unfortunately we've had cases of applicants copying examples they found.

Here are some ideas to share this more privately. We would really appreciate if you followed them:

- Host the code privately and only give access to others upon request. This is the best way to ensure it's not easy to find.

- Share only a few of the files, but not enough to tie everything together.

- Host it on your own server, or bitbucket instead of github.
